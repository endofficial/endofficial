## 🚀 About Me
Hi there! I’m Andrea, a Junior Software Developer and Computer Engineering graduate based in Sicily, Italy (and I'm ready to relocate for the right opportunity!).

I am deeply focused on mastering the tools and practices that define a high-quality Software Developer. My core stack revolves around C#, .NET, and SQL, with a particular emphasis on Entity Framework Core to bridge the gap between robust databases and elegant .NET objects. Visual Studio is my IDE of choice for building scalable applications.

📚 Continuous Learning
I’m a proactive self-starter, currently sharpening my skills through:

Deep Dive: Studying C# 13 and .NET 9 by Mark J. Price and diving into the official Microsoft documentation.

Certifications: Proudly earned the Foundational C# with Microsoft certification via freeCodeCamp.

Project-Based Growth: Following The C# Academy roadmap to build professional-grade, real-world projects.

⚡ Fun Facts
* 🐾 Huge animal lover.

* 🤿 Passionate about underwater exploration and scuba diving.

* 🏎️ Car enthusiast.

* 🚫☕ Unlike most developers, I’m not a coffee fanatic!
